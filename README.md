Error Verification

## Getting Started

1. Even parity bit
To test the code, type 'python3 pair.py' on your terminal to run the code.
It will ask to enter a number which the code will convert to binary.
It will then return and output the even parity bit result.

2. Odd parity bit
To test the code, type 'python3 impair.py' on your terminal to run the code.
It will ask to enter a number which the code will convert to binary.
It will then return and output the odd parity bit result.

3. Checksum
You first need to compile the code with the code 'g++ cs.cpp -o cs'
Then execute with './cs'
The code will ask you to enter a string which it will perform checksum1 and checksum2

### Prerequisites

You just need to clone the git repository onto your computer or download it's zip file and extract it.
For the even & odd parity bit, you need python3 on your system. To install it use the code 'sudo apt-get install python3'
For the checksum, you need to compile and execute the c++ code with which you need to install g++ with the code 'sudo apt-get install g++'

## Built With
